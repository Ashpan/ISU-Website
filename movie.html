<em>Cast Away</em> directed by Robert Zemeckis is a book about a FedEx worker who gets stranded on an island. The movie displays how he survives on the island all alone. My task was to watch the movie and write a review of the movie that focused on the topic of survival. To display my understanding I wrote an essay (this can be seen down below). To write my essay I refered to the rubric and my movie review template provided by my teacher.

                    Cast Away is an interesting watch about adventure, suspense, survival, and a little bit of romance. This film was directed by Robert Zemeckis on December 2000; ImageMovers Playtone published this 143-minute film. The most prevalent idea being expressed in the movie is that survival skills are essential to all life on Earth and without those skills, in nature we would die. This movie was an amazing film due to the magnificent character portrayal along with the acting skills and the conflicts being represented in this film, specifically the conflict between man and nature.

                    Cast Away is a great film through the acting skills of the main character which gave a sense of realism. Cast Away was an entertaining film to watch through its portrayal of Chuck Noland. Tom Hanks played Chuck Noland exceptionally well and had the audience convinced that Chuck was a lost survivor on an unknown island. This is seen in the film when Chuck Noland is finally makes a fire. The emotion he has in his eyes after making the fire seemed like he had received a miracle. Hanks made this moment very realistic and if the audience had not already known it was a movie, they would have been convinced that the scene was a reality. Most of the audience would felt the same way that Chuck is feeling through his acting which allows the audience to feel empathy for Chuck, especially during Chucks' troubles in the island.

                    The main conflict in the movie is man vs nature. This movie demonstrates how there can be many natural forces against mankind. This movie also illustrates how to face these forces and to deal or conquer them. At one point of the movie, there was a big ship in the ocean; after seeing the ship Chuck decided to take an emergency raft and row towards the ship for help. Unfortunately, in the process of rowing to the ship, tidal waves kept coming, which resulted in him eventually giving up. Chuck represented the conflict was there on the island. He also shows how he dealt with the uncontrollable outside forces that were acting completely against him. To be able to conquer the conflict, Chuck knew he had to make something bigger and better than the emergency raft, which he did and was successful that ensured that the conflict did not affect him.

                    This movie was definitely an intriguing watch, during the whole movie the viewers' eyes were glued to the screen and they would did not want to miss a single second of it. Everyone should definitely take two hours out of their time to watch this movie because of three reasons: its main conflict, its cinematography, and Chucks' portrayal.
